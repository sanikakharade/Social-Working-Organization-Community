    1)EARTH 5R<br>
    Saurabh Gupta is the founder of Earth5R. Saurabh embarked upon this journey when he quit his lucrative job at Cafe Coffee Day India to bicycle around different countries, riding more than 50,000 kilometres in little more than two years. According to Saurabh, “Bicycling is an exercise for mind, it helped me develop voice and purpose. With every kilometre that I peddled an idea was being firmed in my mind.” Over the course of his journey, he felt the need of citizens involvement in sustainable development against the increasing environmental risks which inspired him to launch Earth5R. Saurabh says that ACT Global is not just a sentimental vision of Earth5R, the world needs a participative model and it’s urgent! Trying to change the world on a bicycle, one locality at a time. Saurabh Gupta is trying to explore and spread awareness about ways to adopt green practices. You understand how everyday living could be better with clean energy, composting, recycling and supporting the community through sustainable livelihood while turning your waste into a resource.<br><br>
    
    
    2)CLIMATE COLLECTIVE PUNE<br>
    With just 1°C rise in the average temperature of the Earth till date, impacts of ‘Global Warming’ and climate changes like extreme weather events, frequent flooding, extended droughts, more violent hurricanes, polar ice melting etc. are already visible.Most Nations have agreed that Earth must not be allowed to get warmer than 2°C to prevent catastrophic impacts of Climate Change. Yet action on the ground is alarmingly poor because of inadequate awareness about this invisible but imminent danger.Pune International Centre (PIC) in May 2018 organized a workshop on ‘Climate Literacy’ (Awareness) in collaboration with Centre for Environment Education (CEE) and several other environmental NGOs and expert groups.The “Climate Collective Pune” group (CCP) evolved from there for collective actions to enhance the public awareness about the climate change at every level – individuals, communities, institutions and businesses and to create a citizen movement for ‘Climate Action’ for making the Pune region ‘Carbon Neutral’ by 2030<br>
