    1)Jeevitnadi organisation<br>
    At Jeevitnadi, we firmly believe that river revival is possible through active participation of the citizens.<br>
    Inspired by prominent ecologist Late Shri Prakash Gole, alumni of Ecological Society came together in 2014 to work for revival of rivers in Pune.<br>
    This was a group of individuals from diverse professional fields who were passionate about environment conservation and their main focus was on changing perception of people about the rivers and bringing back the lost connection particularly in the urban areas.This initiative to protect rivers evolved into Jeevitnadi.<br>
    In September 2016, Jeevitnadi became a section 8 company, registered under the name Jeevitnadi â€“ Living River Foundation.<br>
    Jeevitnadi works on various projects and is associated as one of the founders of Ramnadi restoration mission.<br>
    It is also on advisory panels and recipient of many accolades and awards.<br>

    2) PUNE PLOGGERS<br>
    Plune Ploggers was founded by Vivek Gurav in 2019.<br>
    It is the first of its kind team plogging every weekend in different areas in Pune.<br>
    Pune ploggers have completed 180 successful plogging drives till now.<br>
    In the last eight months, they have conducted nearly 100 plogging drives in Baner Hills, Dighi Hills, stretches of river Mutha, Pune railway station, and Sinhagadh Fort.<br>
    They also have plogging chapters in Mumbai, Nashik, Nagpur, Aurangabad.<br>
    They have started 3 interesting initiatives:<br>
    Plogging (Picking up plastic while jogging)<br>
    Chalk of Shame (Drawing chalk rangolis beside cigarette butts to shame those cigarette smokers who litter the environment by throwing cigarette butts on the road or water sources instead of dustbins)<br>
    Ecobricking (a campaign during this pandemic to mobilize the citizens locked inside their homes, to make use of their leisure by segregating waste and sort plastic out of it.<br>
    The plastic will further then be used by the team of Pune Ploggers to make &quot;Eco-bricks&quot; - which are plastic bottles stuffed with plastic covers and material of plastic to set the volume and strength to utilize them as usual clay bricks in construction.)<br>
