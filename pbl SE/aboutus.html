											<h1>Hi, We are<br />
											 DEEPASTAMBH</h1>
											<p>A Network for the Social Working Organisations.
                         Empowering Communities, Changing Lives!</p>
										</header>
										<p>The primary purpose of a network of NGOs is to foster collaboration, coordination, and knowledge exchange among its member organizations. By sharing expertise, best practices, and resources, these networks aim to address complex social, environmental, or humanitarian challenges more effectively. Networks of NGOs often focus on specific thematic areas or sectors, such as human rights, healthcare, education, environmental conservation, or poverty alleviation. They serve as platforms for NGOs to collectively advocate for policy changes, influence decision-making processes, and engage in joint initiatives or campaigns. Here is where we come in. DEEPASTAMBH does a noble job of connecting to different NGOs and fulfill the need with collective contribution.</p>
